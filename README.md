## ü¶ä Creating a New Firefox User Profile

To use a persistent Firefox profile for automation (for example, to keep logins or settings), you should create a dedicated Firefox user profile:

1. **Open Firefox.**
2. In the address bar, enter:
   ```
   about:profiles
   ```
   and press Enter.
3. Click **"Create a New Profile"** and follow the instructions.
   - Give your profile a name (e.g., `selenium-profile`).
   - After creation, note the **Root Directory** path shown for your new profile‚Äîthis is the folder you will use in your configuration. Alternatively, adapt the the standard path: "data/.firefoxdriver_user_data"
4. (Optional) Launch Firefox with this profile to set up logins or preferences as needed.
5. (Optional, if profile path was not modified to default) In your `scripts/config.py`, set the profile path:
   ```python
   firefoxdriver_user_data_dir = r"C:\Path\To\Your\New\Profile"
   ```
   Replace the path with the **Root Directory** you copied in step 3.

**Tip:**  
Never use your main/default Firefox profile for automation, as it may cause conflicts or data loss. Always create and use a dedicated profile for Selenium.

## üìù Usage

From the project root, run:

```bash
python teamcaptain.py
```

You will be presented with an interactive menu.  
Choose options to update tasks, generate files, open browser tabs, send WhatsApp messages, and more.

---

## üìÑ URL File Format

- Place URLs in `data/urls.txt`.
- Use placeholders like `{taskID}`, `{classURL}`, `{classFile}` for dynamic replacement.
- Use `{WIN:N}` to open URLs in specific windows. If no window is specified, {WIN:0} is the default choice
- `{WIN:I}` tells the script to open **one window per competition class** for the given URL.
- If the URL contains class placeholders (like `{taskID}`, `{classURL}`, `{classFile}`), the script will generate a separate URL for each class, replacing the placeholders accordingly.
- Each generated URL will be opened in its own window, in the order classes are defined in your configuration.
- This is useful for tracking or visualization sites where you want a dedicated window for each class.

**Example:**
```
https://www.example.com
{WIN:2} https://another.com/{taskID}
{WIN:I}https://ogn.cloud/?tsk=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrik1g/teamcaptain-scripts/main/data/tasks/{classFile}.tsk&lst=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrik1g/teamcaptain-scripts/main/data/gliders/{classFile}.txt
```

## üìä Database File Usage

The script uses an Excel database file (`data/database.xlsx`) to manage and store pilot, glider, and registration information for the competition.  
This file is referenced in your configuration as `database_path` in [`scripts/config.py`](scripts/config.py).

### How to Use the Database

- **Location:**  
  Place your Excel file at `data/database.xlsx` (or update the path in `config.py` if you move it).

- **Structure:**  
  The database should contain at least the following columns:
  - `Pilot Name`
  - `Glider Type`
  - `Competition Number`
  - `Registration`
  - `Class`
  - (Add any other fields your workflow requires)

- **Editing:**  
  Edit the file using Excel, LibreOffice, or any spreadsheet editor.  
  Save your changes before running the script.

- **Purpose:**  
  The script reads this file to generate glider lists, task files, and to ensure all pilot and glider data is up to date for each competition class.  
  Any updates to pilot or glider information should be made in this file.

- **Customization:**  
  If you add or rename columns, update the relevant code in `scripts/glider_utils.py` and `scripts/task_utils.py` to match your new structure.

### Example Workflow

1. Update pilot/glider data in `data/database.xlsx`.
2. Run the script (`python teamcaptain.py`) and choose the menu option to update tasks and gliders.
3. The script will read the latest data from the database and generate the necessary files for tracking and scoring platforms.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Weather Briefing Setup & Usage

The script can automatically generate and process weather briefings using the [metbrief](https://github.com/jkretz/metbrief) tool.

### 1. Install and Configure metbrief

- The `metbrief` tool is included as a subfolder in `externals/metbrief`.
- Edit `externals/metbrief/user_details.py` and add your login details for services like flugwetter.de and TopMeteo.

### 2. Configure Paths

- Make sure `weather_briefing_path` in [`scripts/config.py`](scripts/config.py) points to the correct folder (usually something like `externals/metbrief/briefings/tabor_25`).

### 3. Generate a Weather Briefing

- The script will call `metbrief.py` automatically when you select the weather briefing option from the menu.
- This will:
  - Download the latest weather data and charts.
  - Create a new folder for today‚Äôs date in the briefing directory.
  - Generate an `.odp` (LibreOffice presentation) and convert it to PDF.

### 4. Open or Send the Briefing

- The script can open the generated weather briefing in LibreOffice or send the PDF to WhatsApp (if configured).

### Notes & Tips

- **First-time setup:**  
  You should run `metbrief.py` at least once manually to ensure all dependencies are installed and credentials are set.
- **Customization:**  
  You must adjust the template and chart sources in the `metbrief` folder as needed for your competition.
- **Troubleshooting:**  
  If weather briefing generation fails, check the logs in the terminal and ensure your credentials and paths are correct.

## üóÇÔ∏è Git Configuration & Manual Push

### Git Setup

- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed and configured with your SSH key or credentials.
- The script uses the SSH key specified in `scripts/config.py` (see the `os.environ['GIT_SSH_COMMAND']` line).
- If you need to change the SSH key, update the path in `config.py`:
  ```python
  os.environ['GIT_SSH_COMMAND'] = 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa'
  ```
- Ensure your user name and email are set:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

### Files to Push Manually

If you choose to push updates manually (or if automatic git push is disabled), make sure to add and commit the following files after running the script:

- **Task files:**  
  All files in `data/tasks/` (e.g., `.tsk`, `.cup`, `.txt`, `.json`)

- **Glider files:**  
  All files in `data/gliders/`

- **Weather briefings:**  
  All files in `externals/metbrief/briefings/tabor_25/` (or your configured `weather_briefing_path`)

- **Database:**  
  `data/database.xlsx` (if you made changes to pilot/glider data)

**Example manual workflow:**
```bash
git add data/tasks/* data/gliders/* externals/metbrief/briefings/tabor_25/* data/database.xlsx
git commit -m "Update tasks, gliders, and weather briefing"
git push
```

**Tip:**  
If you add new files or folders, make sure they are not excluded by `.gitignore`.

## üîß Enabling or Disabling Automatic Git Push

By default, the script can automatically commit and push changes to your git repository after updates (such as new task, glider, or weather briefing files).  
You can enable or disable this feature at any time from the interactive menu.

### How to Change Git Push Settings

1. **Start the script:**
   ```bash
   python teamcaptain.py
   ```

2. **From the main menu, select the option to update Git settings.**
   - The menu will display the current setting (enabled or disabled).
   - You will be prompted:
     ```
     Do you want to enable automatic git commit and push after updates? (Y/N)?
     ```
   - Enter `y` to enable or `n` to disable automatic git commit and push.

3. **Effect:**
   - If enabled, the script will automatically add, commit, and push relevant files after each update.
   - If disabled, you must manually add, commit, and push files using git (see the section above for which files to push).

**Tip:**  
You can change this setting as often as you like from the menu.  
The current setting is stored in memory for the current session.
